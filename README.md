A Raspberry Pi 3B+-powered autonomous truck system that detects STOP signs using a webcam and measures distances with an ultrasonic sensor. The system integrates Flask for real-time data communication and stores data in a MariaDB database. An iOS app (in Swift) displays distance readings, truck status (moving/stopped), and STOP sign detection to enhance monitoring.
